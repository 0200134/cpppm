🧩 cpppm — C++ Package Manager (to become…)

> To become the simplest, cross-platform, zero-dependency package manager for C++.



     


---

🚀 Overview

cpppm is a minimal, self-contained package manager that treats dependencies as
Git repositories + CMake glue code.

No centralized registry, no lock-in, no complexity — just:

git clone + add_subdirectory() + CMake

It’s designed for:

Embedded, offline, or air-gapped builds

Experimental or bootstrap compiler projects

Teams that need 100% reproducible dependency graphs

✨ Features

🧱 Zero installation — just compile tools/cpppm.cpp

🧾 Simple manifest (cpppm.cfg)

🔗 Git-based dependency fetch

⚙️ Auto-generated CMake stub

🧩 Cross-platform: Linux / macOS / Windows

🧠 Ideal for: CMake + Git + reproducible workflows

🚫 No registry. No lock-in.

🔧 Quick Start

# Compile cpppm
c++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o cpppm tools/cpppm.cpp

# Initialize
./cpppm init

# Add dependencies
./cpppm add fmt https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git tag=10.2.1
./cpppm add catch2 https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git tag=v3.5.4

# Install + Build
./cpppm install
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build


---

🧾 Example Manifest (cpppm.cfg)

name=myproj
dep=fmt|https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git|tag=10.2.1|subdir=
dep=catch2|https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git|tag=v3.5.4|subdir=

Each line =
dep=<name>|<repo_url>|tag=<version>|subdir=<path>


---

⚙️ CMake Integration

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(myproj CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_executable(myproj src/main.cpp)
include(cmake/cpppm.cmake OPTIONAL)


---

🧹 Clean Up

./cpppm clean

Removes external/ and generated CMake stubs.


---

🧠 Philosophy

cpppm exists for clarity and reproducibility —
not to compete with heavy package managers like vcpkg or conan.

It’s for developers who want:

Total transparency

Zero external dependencies

Offline, auditable, Git-only builds


> No registry. No lock-in. 100% deterministic.

🧭 Ecosystem Integration

cpppm is part of the R3C Foundation Ecosystem
(C++ → Rust → NASM LLVM-Zero compiler pipeline).

It acts as the dependency and reproducibility layer for:

🧱 R3C Core compiler

🦀 Rust-LTSS / Embedded-LTSS

🌌 Beyond-LLVM experiments
